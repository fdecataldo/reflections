When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would like to use a remote repository to cloud my work, both for working on
    different devices or to collaborate with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It's better to pull changes manually because it can be some conflicts in what you made locally and what's on remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is the same as cloning, but on an existing repository on github, all made in remote (maybe because you don't have the rights to change it).
    Clones are needed to copy locally a remote repository, or to make a copy from local to local.
    Branches are needed to make different versions of your files. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It's useful to make diff and status about the local changes versus the last known remote commit.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I think I would use email or google drive.
    Without git and github it's difficult to track changes or highlight the differences between two versions of some file.
    But there's some additional work to track evertything and to learn how to do it.
    So all the collaborators must know how to manage git and github.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I want to make changes in separate branches when I want to try new
    features or something I'm not sure to incorporate into master branch.
    After I can pull request or directly merge into master.
